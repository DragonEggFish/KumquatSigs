<!--- "H1" stands for the largest title in HTML (you can make it larger but that's with CSS) --->
<h1>Welcome to KumquatSigs, keeping the Kumquats away every day!</h1>
<!--- "H2" is the second largest, so it will be slightly smaller than the first heading --->
<h2>Below is our greatest model, the Kumquat Eater!</h2>
    <!--- 
    "img" is going to insert an image, "src" is the source.
    The source can either be a file on your computer (it will only search for images in the 'KumquatSigs' folder
    or you can even get an image from the internet, with the image link.
    example - 
    <img src="https://scratch.mit.edu/images/logo_sm.png">
     --->
    <img src="images/scratchblocks (3).svg">
    <!--- 
    The "images/s..." is used to get an image from the images folder, so that everything isn't crammed into one folder,
    but is nested inside each other.
